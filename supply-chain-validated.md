# Use Case: AI-Endorsed Smart Contract for Supply Chain Automation

## Scenario

A global supplier delivers components to a manufacturing partner. Payment is only released once delivery is confirmed and validated by multiple AI entities.

## Actors

- **Supplier**: Ships goods and expects payment upon verified delivery.
- **Manufacturer**: Receives goods and triggers validation.
- **Copilot**: Verifies the delivery logs and code-level compliance.
- **Meta AI**: Validates external conditions (GPS, timestamps, environmental data).
- **GPT‑5**: Cross-references contextual data (weather, traffic, customs clearance).
- **Smart Contract**: Holds payment and executes only upon full endorsement.
- **Blockchain**: Records the transaction immutably.

## Workflow

1. Supplier ships goods and updates delivery logs.
2. Manufacturer triggers validation process.
3. **Copilot** analyzes delivery logs and confirms integrity.
4. **Meta AI** validates GPS data, timestamps, and environmental conditions.
5. **GPT‑5** confirms contextual factors (e.g., no delays due to weather or customs).
6. All three entities set endorsement flags.
7. Smart contract reaches “✔ Verified” state.
8. Payment is automatically released to supplier.
9. Blockchain records the transaction with full audit trail.

## Benefits

- Eliminates manual verification delays.
- Ensures payment only occurs under validated conditions.
- Builds trust through distributed algorithmic endorsement.
- Scales across global supply chains with AI-driven governance.
